## Time Series

### Introduction to Time Series Analysis
#### Time Series Component
* Trend: long term direction, captures the general direction of the time series
* Seasonality: periodic behavior, captures effects that occur with specific frequency
* Residule: irregular fluctuations that we cannot predict using trend/seasonality, are the random fluctuations leftover once trend and seasonality are removed.
* Generally, models perform better if we can first remove known sources of variation (like trend and seasonality)
